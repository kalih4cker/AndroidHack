## ❗Legal Notice

Spying on someone’s phone without their **knowledge or consent** is not just shady—it’s **illegal**.  
You’re not James Bond, and this isn’t a Hollywood movie. 🎬🚫  
So unless you enjoy orange jumpsuits and no internet, **get permission** first.  
Be cool. Be legal. Use responsibly. 😎📱⚖️
